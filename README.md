## Getting Started

### Downloading the prebuilt files

Prebuilt files can be downloaded from http://jqueryvalidation.org/

### Downloading the latest changes

The unreleased development files can be obtained by:

 1. [Downloading](https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/archive/master.zip) or Forking this repository
 2. [Setup the build](CONTRIBUTING.md#build-setup)
 3. Run `grunt` to create the built files in the "dist" directory

### Including it on your page

Include jQuery and the plugin on a page. Then select a form to validate and call the `validate` method.

```html
<form>
	<input required>
</form>
<script src="jquery.js"></script>

<script>
$("form").validate();
</script>
```

Alternatively include jQuery and the plugin via requirejs in your module.

```js
define(["jquery", "jquery.validate"], function( $ ) {
	$("form").validate();
});
```

## Reporting an Issue

**IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT EMAIL VALIDATION**. As of version 1.12.0 this plugin is using the same regular expression that the [HTML5 specification suggests for browsers to use](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/states-of-the-type-attribute.html#e-mail-state-%28type=email%29). We will follow their lead and use the same check. If you think the specification is wrong, please report the issue to them.

1. Make sure the problem you're addressing is reproducible.
2. Use http://jsbin.com or http://jsfiddle.net to provide a test page.
3. Indicate what browsers the issue can be reproduced in. **Note: IE Compatibilty modes issues will not be addressed.**
4. What version of the plug-in is the issue reproducible in. Is it reproducible after updating to the latest version.
